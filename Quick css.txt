rem : root element
 saying 2 rem will imply saying 2 times the size of it's root. the root here is according
 to html tree hierachy and stuff. for instance header is the root of p. But if 2 rem is given
 to the p tag without specifying header styling, it will fetch the browser's font size instead

em: element 
 equivalent to the font size of the direct current element

- % is a better choice for horizontal size setting

- setting body size to full screen and not just content min-height: 100vh.

- box-sizing: border box really helps calculate exactly the size we're assigning 
  to elements: as it includes border, padding and content (not margin) into the assigned
  width or height. on the other border-content will set only the content of elements 
  to the assigned size (excluding padding and border)

- TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT
- Inherit; is very usefull as it makes child elements have parent properties. normally
  children do not have direct access to parent properties until parents give them access to 
  it
- We can't apply margin to inline elements but to block elements rather
- Inline-block is a hybrid as it makes the styled element remain inline(not going to a new line)
  and padding and margin can be applied to it normally. Used for buttons and clickables very often
- display: none can be used to logically remove an element from rendering
- a nice place to use px instead of rem is when defining border radius

 [ Flex-box ]

- All elements default to static
- setting an element's position to relative makes it an ancestor for indented elements
- sticky block sticks to a container or any defined element
- fixed is fixed, absolute 
- html{scroll-behavior: smooth} hahah

- align-content defines the distance between lines(rows) while align-item define how
  the items as a whole are aligned within a container. align-content therefore has no
  effect when there's only one line.
- setting the display type of an element to flex indeed is making it look kind of like normal
  elements in flutter. space-around, space-between, mainAxisAlignment(flex-direction) and stuff



 [ CSS Grid ]

- display: grid
- check where to and where not to put commas ','  !!
- fraction units used specifically for css grid. 'fr'
- Do not! comment with ' // ' in css. never! comment with /* */ instead. okay? Good!
- align-content aligns grid items vertically
- justify-content aligns grid items horizontally

- Mmm learned about aside elements used for things like side bars, ads, related posts/links , 
  promotional content and that kind of stuff

- grid auto rows specifies the height of rows in a grid

-grid column start and end are used to define were columns grid elements start and end
- you could also set thier values to negative 
- grid-column and grid-row could be used as shortcuts . (instead of grid-row-start 1 grid-row-end 2 --> grid-row: 1/2)
- grid-auto-rows: minmax(150px, auto). row will have minimum height of 150px and will Grow with the content


[CSS Images]

- images are inline elements
- can make them block elements by changing thier display property to block. It also removes
  space under the image. ( Inline elements have space underneath by default.)

- always use an image that is twice as big as where you're planning to display


[Media Queries]
- Mobile first designs. It's easier to design mobile or small version first and then expand
  it to the size we want
- md file -> Markdown file
- iPhone 5/SE one of the smallest mobile devices.. mmm
- Shift+Alt+downArrow : past down
- Selection and Ctrl+D to select following item for edit in VS Code
- Wow one of the funniest mess. Do not indent media queries!!! one at a time and close it's 
  bracket. wow.
- scroll-margin top not Scroll-padding-top. Make sure you do not use the word padding instead
  margin and vice versa. 😭😭
