rem : root element
 saying 2 rem will imply saying 2 times the size of it's root. the root here is according
 to html tree hierachy and stuff. for instance header is the root of p. But if 2 rem is given
 to the p tag without specifying header styling, it will fetch the browser's font size instead

em: element 
 equivalent to the font size of the direct current element

- % is a better choice for horizontal size setting

- setting body size to full screen and not just content min-height: 100vh.

- box-sizing: border box really helps calculate exactly the size we're assigning 
  to elements: as it includes border, padding and content (not margin) into the assigned
  width or height. on the other border-content will set only the content of elements 
  to the assigned size (excluding padding and border)

- TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT
- Inherit; is very usefull as it makes child elements have parent properties. normally
  children do not have direct access to parent properties until parents give them access to 
  it
